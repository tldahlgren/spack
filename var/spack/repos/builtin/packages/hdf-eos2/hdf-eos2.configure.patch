# Fix some issues with hdf-eos2 configure script
# configure (according to config.log) would find the jpeg
# and libz libs, but then abort complaining they were not
# found because HAVE_LIBJPEG, etc not set (the script just
# appended the lines to confdefs.h but not set in the environment
# of the running script and script tests the env variable)
